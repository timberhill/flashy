```Fun LED Array Screen Halo yisss```

This is a project aimed to utilise python, adafruit/arduino and an strip of LEDs to create a glow around a monitor that extends it in a way.
It's a work in progress and will be improved.
Current aim is:

- read the colour values off a screen
- send them to the microcontroller
- light up the LEDs accordingly
    - kind of like Logitech lighsync but simpler

## Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Python 3+

Plus some coding exp because this project is in its infancy. Feel free to contact me. Good luck.
